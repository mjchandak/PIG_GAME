Overview:

Pig Game is an exciting dice game web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a fun and competitive experience for two players, named Player 1 and Player 2. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a score of 100 or more. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points, with the option to "hold" their score and pass the turn to the other player.

Features:

1. Two-Player Gameplay: Allows two players to participate in the game, competing against each other to reach a score of 100 or more.

2. Dice Rolling: Players can roll a dice to accumulate points during their turn. The value of the rolled dice is added to the player's current score.

3. Hold Score: Provides a "Hold" button for each player, allowing them to save their current score and pass the turn to the other player.

4. Winning Condition: The game ends as soon as one player reaches or exceeds a score of 100. That player is declared the winner, and the game resets for a new round.
